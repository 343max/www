<p><a href="http://owncloud.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/owncloud-copyright-assignment-common.pdf">Download the agreement (pdf)</a><br /></p><p>We release the ownCloud core and the desktop clients and the Android App under a dual license. Because of that we require a signed 
contributor agreement from developer that want to commit code into the ownCloud core repository. 
This only applies to this repositories, not the apps or other parts.<p>
<h3>A contributor agreement? Does this mean that ownCloud is no longer free software?</h3>
<p>It´s true some of the contributor agreements for other projects are critical because they allow the 
company to make the software proprietary in the future, which is obviously bad. We have a special 
contributor agreement that guarantees in the document that every contribution from developers is 
always released as AGPL (or GPL in the case of the desktop clients or the Android App). AGPL/GPL is the licenses of ownCloud anyways which means that it´s 
guaranteed that the complete ownCloud is available under AGPL and will always be AGPL. This 
can´t be changed, so there is no drawback to the old situation. <p>
<h3>Does this mean that everybody who wants to work on ownCloud has to sign this agreement?</h3>
<p>No. Only the ownCloud core is covered by this contributor agreement. If you are familiar with the 
architecture of ownCloud than you know that ownCloud contains out of a lot of small modules 
called apps. We don´t require a contributor agreement for all this modules. Only for the core, the clients and android.<p>
<h3>But I want to contribute to ownCloud and still don´t want to sign a contributor agreement.</h3>
What can I do?
<p>We can accept your core contribution if you release your code under the MIT license. Of course we 
recommend that you sign the agreement because AGPL/GPL protects your work better than MIT.<p>
<h3>How difficult is it to sign the agreement?</h3>
Very easy. Take the PDF and send it by mail or scan to: 
frank@owncloud.com<br><br> 
or<br><br>
Frank Karlitschek<br>
Alexanderstrasse 80<br>
70182 Stuttgart<br>
Germany<p>
<p>We will give you complete commit rights as soon as we got your agreement.
<h3>Is there any risk for me when I sign this agreement?</h3>
<p>We don´t think so. You have to give us the right to use your software patents if you have any and if 
they apply to your patch. That’s all. Probably not a problem for you because software patents are 
bad and we all don´t hold any patents anyway.<p>
<h3>Why do you require a contributor agreement now?</h3>
<p>We thought a lot about the relationship between the company and community and about a solutions 
that is best for both parties. The company wants to have a business model so that the company can 
sell software, support and services to big companies. The revenue will be used to fund development 
of ownCloud, marketing, services, sponsoring and so on. 
The community wants to be sure that all the contributions and all the hard work stays free software. 
The free software community also benefits from the resources that the company invests into 
ownCloud which will guarantied stay free software. So we think that we found a solution here 
which is good for all parties.<p>
<h3>Are there any examples for this model out there so that I can see how this works in practice?</h3>
<p>It very similar to the way Trolltech/Nokia developed Qt. Contributor have to sign the contributor 
agreement so that Trolltech can sell the commercial version of Qt in parallel to the free software 
version. There is also the Free Qt foundation that guarantees that Qt will always be free software 
and the Trolltech/Nokia can´t make a proprietary product of that. That´s very similar to what we 
have here.<p>

presentation a few month ago:
He basically suggests the same system that we have here because it is fair for a free software 
perspective.<p>
