<h2>Contribution guidelines</h2>
<p>To find out how to write ownCloud code, check out our <a href="<?php echo $DOCUMETNATION_DEVELOPER; ?>">developer documentation here</a>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We use <a href="https://github.com/owncloud">Github</a>, please get an account there and
	clone the repositories you want to work on</li>
	<li>Ideally, discuss your plans on the <a href="http://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/devel">mailing list</a>
	to see if others want to work with you on it</li>
	<li><strong>Fixes</strong> go directly to master, nevertheless they need to be tested thoroughly</li>
	<li><strong>New features</strong> are always developed in a branch and only merged to master once they are fully done</li>
	<li>When you are finished, use the merge request function on Github. The other developers will look at
	it and give you feedback. Ideally also post your merge request to the mailing list to let people know.</li>
	<li>Decisions are <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2013/05/consensus-decision-making.html">made by consensus</a>.
	We strive for making the best technical decisions and as nobody can know everything, we collaborate.
	That means a first negative comment might not be the final word, neither is positive feedback an immediate <em>GO</em>.
	ownCloud is built out of modular pieces (apps) and maintainers have a strong influence. In case of
	disagreement we consult other seasoned contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>TIP</em>: If you are new to git, do the <a href="http://git-scm.com/course/svn.html">git crash course</a>.
We use <a href="http://github.com/owncloud">github</a> for our collaborative development, and they have an excellent
series of tutorials on <a href="https://help.github.com/">help.github.com</a>. Try the <em>'Set Up git'</em>,
<em>'Fork a Repo'</em> and <em>'Be Social'</em> tutorials!</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: For an easy way to get involved, try to implement one of our
<strong><a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues?labels=Junior+Job&state=open/">Junior Jobs</a></strong>
and see the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Project-ideas#coding">project ideas page</a>
(and don't hesitate to contact the mentor of the project you're interested in!)</p>
